# Vending Machine Capstone

This was our cohort's first capstone project, assigned at the end of the first learning module. It was a pair programming exercise completed over 2 days. It was the first time I had been exposed to pair programing and I quickly discovered that I enjoyed the pair programming and collaborative exercises. We were to apply the various principles that had been covered during the module, such as OOP principles, file input and output by reading and updating various text files as appropriate, a menu-driven command line interface, and error checking and exception handling and / or throwing custom errors when generated by user input or the program itself. We also developed the program according to test driven development and developed more tests as we fleshed out the program and learned more about the nuances of the project.


Highlights of the project:

Virtual Vending Machine ran from the Command Line

File I/O: Real-time Editable Text-Based Inventory System

Inheritance and Polymorphism demonstrated in Item Classes

Encapsulation of methods for Business Logic for vending machine functions: EG: money handling, inventory management, sales reports

TDD methodology used for vending machine logic and functions, then test making, and finally coding and development
